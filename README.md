Panorama
========

Panorama - an Enyo 2.0 kind to roughly emulate the horizontal scrolling Panorama Control with a parallax effect in Windows Phone 8.

You can side swipe to slide thru the panels of the panorama, and it wraps around to first panel.  The title and background image are shifted as you scroll thru the panels creating the parallax effect.

Based on the Panels/LeftRightArranger controls.

Declare a "title" as the component to create for the title across the panorama.

Specify "margin" for the amount to 'peek' the next panel, typically ~10% of the viewport on WP.

See example in "sample" directory.


NOTES:

- the title does not 'snap around' when you wrap the carousel, it just slides back
- if there are only two panels, they do not slide correctly
- if there are only three panels, the next panels is not always correctly 'peeked'


Tested platforms include: Chrome 24+, Safari 6.0.2+, Windows Phone 8.0
